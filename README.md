buildroot
=========

Buildroot for xen-api and related packages, producing RPM and (experimentally) Debian packages.

RPM-based distributions
-----------------------

On RPM-based distributions, the packages are built using `mock`.
To install it on a RHEL/CentOS system then you will need to add the
[EPEL repositories](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL). 
Here is a useful article for [CentOS](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/installing-rhel-epel-repo-on-centos-5x-or-6x).


After adding EPEL, install and set up mock:

```
yum install -y mock redhat-lsb-core
```

Mock will refuse to run as root. You must choose a non-privileged user to
run mock as. Type the following as root:

(Note select a `<user>` which isn't "mock" when typing the commands below)

```
useradd <user> -G mock
passwd <user>

su - <user>
```

You are now ready to clone the buildroot repository and build the packages:

```
git clone git://github.com/xenserver/buildroot.git
cd buildroot

./configure.sh
make
```

Finally, install the packages you have just built, run the install wizard to configure your system to boot Xen and start the buildroot components on boot, then reboot:
```
make install
xenserver-install-wizard
reboot
```


Debian-based distributions (experimental)
-----------------------------------------

Building Debian packages is experimental!

The Debian/Ubuntu package build uses [cowbuilder](https://wiki.debian.org/cowbuilder), which needs to run as root, so you may wish to add your user to the `sudoers` list.

The build also depends on OCaml 4.01.0, now available in Ubuntu Trusty and Debian Jessie.

The steps to build Debian packages are the same as those to build RPMs:

```
git clone git://github.com/xenserver/buildroot.git
cd buildroot

./configure.sh
make

make install
xenserver-install-wizard
reboot
```
